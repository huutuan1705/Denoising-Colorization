# Denoising and colorization image
## 1. Introduction
In this project, I focuses on developing advanced image processing techniques to enhance visual content. My goal is convert noisy images to clean image and aim to transform black-and-white images into colorized versions.

I used deep learning models trained (Unet architecture) to remove and recognize various types of noise, resulting in clearer and more visually appealing images

My project seeks to significantly improve the quality and aesthetic appeal of images, making them more useful for a variety of applications in fields such as photography, digital media, and historical preservation.

## 4. Summary
In the future, I will collect more data to improve the model's accuracy. Additionally, I will work on integrating these two models and applying them in mobile or laptop applications
